          <h3>NIKE SB DUNKS: THE COMEBACK</h3>

          <p><strong>The Legacy</strong> The Nike Dunk, created by Peter Moore, was originally released in 1985. As reflected in the shoes name, it was made for basketball, and more specifically, college basketball. Part of the branding behind the shoe was creating different colorways that matched with different college colors, alongside the slogan “Be true to your school”.  Their tactic was to tap into college kids by using team spirit, but an unforeseen consumer fell in love with the shoe as well, skaters. As it turned out, the high top ankle support and added cushioning was perfect for the high impact sport, and the shoe soon became a hit within skate culture. From a combination of Nike’s failing skating wing and the unexpected demand for basketball sneakers by skaters, the Nike SB (skateboarding) Dunk was born.</p> 
	</p>In 2002, the first release of the shoes rolled out in skate shops all across the country, and the reaction was incredible. They kept with the tradition of releasing many different colorways of the Dunk, which brought about another unexpected customer in sneakerheads. As the shoe became more and more popular, people began lining up outside of skate shops on release days in hopes of grabbing limited-release pairs, often to no success. Dunks became known for their creativity and unique colorways, and the resale market started to flourish. Certain pairs were fetching thousands of dollars, and it seemed that the collaborations were just getting crazier and crazier, and then, they kind of just stopped.</p>
	</p>For many years, hyped-up collaborations and extremely unique pairs of Dunks simply weren’t happening. The loyal fan base of skaters stuck around because of their practicality, but for many sneakerheads and clothing enthusiasts, there was nothing too special coming for the skating wing. Occasionally, there would be a token Supreme Dunk, or a repeat collaboration in hopes to increase enthusiasm, but for the most part, Dunks were out of the mainstream, leaving sneaker enthusiasts disappointed and nostalgic of the early 2000’s releases. Things were not looking good, but then, as if a gift from the sneaker gods themselves, two announcements were made. Virgil Abloh and Travis Scott were coming out with Dunks.</p>
	</p>Virgil Abloh made arguably the most sought after shoe of recent years when he released the Off-White Jordan 1 collaboration. An already extremely popular shoe, the Jordan 1 was deconstructed and made completely unique, hosting the signature Off-White quotations and a new orange zip tie. It was the furthest thing from the original silhouette the 1’s had seen in a long time, and then Travis Scott came along and hyped it up even more. Scott took the backbone of all Nike shoes, the swoosh, and flipped it in reverse. The move was unlike anything Jordans had seen, and the hype around them was insane. Both sneakers were going for thousands, so it was to no one's surprise that when they both came out with low top Dunks within a year of each other, there was a massive following. </p>
	</p>Both shoes brought extreme hype and the highest resales of any Nike SB sneakers in recent years. As a result of this, old Dunks’ values have seen sharp increases too, as the newer generations of sneakerheads are starting to appreciate the history more and more. The buzz around the classic sneaker is a refreshing blast from the past, and many look forward to what Nike SB has to offer in upcoming years.
